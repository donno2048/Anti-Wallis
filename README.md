# Anti Wallis

John Wallis was a mathematician who found/discovered/invented the Wallis function (or Wallis product as its friends call it).

The Wallis function is the most used method to calculate pi.

As you have probably figured from the name of this repo I'm not the biggest fan of his function.

This repo is meant to show how horrible the Wallis function is and to ask every developer in the world to demolish it.
